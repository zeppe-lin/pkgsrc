        * rewritten in POSIX sh(1p)
        * added support of suckless' sbase utilities
        * added support of aria2c(1) downloader
        * the man pages have been rewritten in POD
        * added Pkgfile(5) man page
        * added bash completion
        * removed "-i", "-u", and "-r" command-line options
        * removed signify(1) support since zeppe-lin is distributed
          through git(1) with signed commits

    See git log for further differences.
