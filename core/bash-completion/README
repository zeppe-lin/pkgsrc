README bash-completion

POST-INSTALL

    The easiest way to use bash-completion is to source it from either
    /etc/bashrc  or  ~/.bashrc  (or any other file sourcing those).
    You can do this by simply adding the following line:

        . /etc/bash_completion

    You can also put additional init code into ~/.bash_completion.


vim:sw=2:ts=2:sts=2:et:cc=72:tw=70
End of file.
