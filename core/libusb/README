KERNEL CONFIGURATION

    To access raw USB devices (those not treated as a disk by the
    mass-storage driver), appropriate support must be available in the
    kernel.  Check your kernel configuration:

        Device Drivers --->
          [*] USB support --->                    [CONFIG_USB_SUPPORT]
            <*/M> Support for Host-side USB               [CONFIG_USB]
            (Select any USB hardware device drivers you may need)
