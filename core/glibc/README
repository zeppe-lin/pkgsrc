LOCALES

    glibc does not contain locales (except C.UTF-8), thus you'll have
    to generate the locales you need/use.  The following example is a
    typical setup:

        localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8

    After that, add "export LANG=en_US.UTF-8" to /etc/profile.


vim:sw=2:ts=2:sts=2:et:cc=72:tw=70
End of file.
