ABOUT rc

    This directory contains Zeppe-Lin init scripts used in conjunction
    with sysvinit.

    This rc distribution is a fork of CRUX' init scripts (extracted
    from rc port) with the following differences:

        * rewritten in POSIX sh(1p)
        * added man page (rc.conf.5)
        * added rc.netfs to mount network volumes (thanks to LFS)
        * added mdadm(1) to assemble raid volumes

    See git log for further differences.

    The original sources can be downloaded from:
    1. https://crux.nu/ports/crux-3.6/core/rc
    2. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=ports/core.git;a=tree;f=rc
