ABOUT

    This directory contains pkgman source code.
    pkgman is a package management tool that provides additional
    functionality to basic package management utilities like pkgutils.

    This pkgman distribution is a fork of CRUX' prt-get tool as of
    commit da6bfb0 (Fri Oct 16 2020).  It was almost completely
    rewritten from a "C-like" coding standard to high-level c++17
    primitives.  This enabled aggressive optimization (-O3 and above).
    So-called "prt-cache" functionality have been removed since there
    is no need for prt-cache when there is Linux's PageCache+NVMe.
    The man pages have been rewritten in POD format.  Build system
    have been switched from autotools to make(1p).  A command-line
    interface also have been rewritten.

    The original sources can be downloaded from:
    1. git://crux.nu/tools/prt-get.git
    2. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/prt-get.git;a=summary
