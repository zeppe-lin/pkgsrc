URGENT WINDOW NOTIFY

    Since the notifications in the Sylpheed are pretty ugly, and the
    current build is not patched for libnotify support, Tile-WM-Users
    can use the standard tag notifications:

    Sylpheed -> Configuration -> Common preferences ...
      * Execute command when new messages arrive
        xdotool search --class Sylpheed set_window -urgency 1

    If the last command not working, try this:

        xdotool search --name Sylpheed set_window --urgency 1

    Remember to install xdotool, and enjoy tag notifications ;-)
