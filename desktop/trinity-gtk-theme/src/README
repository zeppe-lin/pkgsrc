ABOUT trinity-gtk-theme

    This directory contains trinity-gtk-theme source code.
    Trinity theme is a GTK-2.0/3.0 theme for GTK+ toolkit.  It is
    based on the @jschwentker's, @ro1ri's and @elbullazul's trinity
    themes.

    This distribution is a fork of Christian Medel's (@elbullazul)
    Trinity as of commit c58796d (Thu Aug 15 2019).  Unnecessary
    Azurra Framework files have been removed.  Theme was modified for
    thin scrollbars.  Colorscheme have been modified both in css and
    png images.  Added generation of gresource file and index.theme.
