README transset-df

REQUIREMENTS

    First of all, for transparency to work in X you have to have
    X-server with XComposite extension working.  transset-df is not a
    program that creates transparency, it's a program that sets
    properties for windowses.  These properties must then be supported
    by the underlaying X-server.

    Use picom as composite manager, for example.

CONFIGURATION

    You can use keyboard or mouse shortcuts to set transparency value
    to the focused windows.

  Keyboard Bindings

    See dwm's config.def.h for example.

  Mouse Bindings

    The "scrollwheel method" can be realized via xbindkeys.  Bind
    pressing control + scrolling up to "transset-df -p --inc 0.1" and
    pressing control + scrolling down to "transset-df --min 0.1 -p
    --dec 0.2".  The "--min"-flag makes sure you'll not be able to
    make windowses invisible.

        ~/.xbindkeysrc:

        "transset-df --min 0.1 -p --dec 0.2"
        control + b:4
        "transset-df -p --inc 0.1"
        control + b:5
