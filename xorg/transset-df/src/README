ABOUT transset-df

    This directory contains the transset-df source code tarball.
    transset-df is a patched version of xorg's transset with
    additional functionality.

    The program is old (last update 2007-09-21), and sometimes
    homepage (<https://forchheimer.se/transset-df/>) is not available.

    Let's save it here.
