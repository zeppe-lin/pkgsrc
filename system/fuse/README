KERNEL CONFIGURATION

    Enable the following options in the kernel configuration and
    recompile the kernel if necessary:

        File Systems --->
          <*/M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
                                                      [CONFIG_FUSE_FS]

    Character devices in user space should be enabled too if running
    the tests:

        File Systems --->
          <*/M> FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support
                                                      [CONFIG_FUSE_FS]
