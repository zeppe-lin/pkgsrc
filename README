ABOUT zeppe-lin

    This directory contains Zeppe-Lin source code: packages' build
    scripts and sometimes packages' source code which make up
    so-called "GNU/Linux distribution".  Zeppe-Lin contains software
    written by a lot of different people, and each software package
    comes with its own license, chosen by its author(s).  To find out
    how package is licensed, have a loot at its source code.
    Sometimes, for obsolete software or software whose source code is
    hard to find, the package' source (build scripts and so) may
    contain side by side the source code of the software itself.  As a
    rule, there is a license file next to the source code, which may
    differ from the Zeppe-Lin license.  If there is no license file,
    then the code is distributed under the same conditions as the
    Zeppe-Lin itself.  Feel free to open an issue if you find the
    missing one.

    See Zeppe-Lin Handbook (<https://zeppe-lin.github.io>) for an
    initial introduction to Zeppe-Lin.

PACKAGES' SOURCES

    They were originally forked from "CRUX 3.6 ports" and thus
    inherits CRUX' license and copyrights.  All packages' sources
    (build scripts) in Zeppe-Lin are Copyright (C) 2000-2021 by
    Per Lid√©n and CRUX development team and released under the
    GNU General Public license version 3 or (at your opinion) any
    later version.

    The original sources can be downloaded from:
    1. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=ports/core.git;a=snapshot;h=8892897fa5565861102cf7368edb118b19e11761;sf=tgz
    2. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=ports/core.git;a=tree;h=8892897fa5565861102cf7368edb118b19e11761;hb=d2cef9dd2ac01f84411c2f6c780cd558ab87f89f

    These build scripts were further reworked: they were rewritten in
    the POSIX sh(1) and Zeppe-Lin had its own criteria for what
    packages should be in so-called core collection, what should be in
    opt, xorg and so on.

    See "The Packages' Sources System"
    (<https://zeppe-lin.github.io/#THE-PACKAGES-SOURCES-SYSTEM>)
    for an introduction.
